\textbf{2.1 Defining Artificial Intelligence:}
\end{center}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands as a field of computer science that
seeks to imbue machines with capabilities traditionally associated with
human intelligence. At its core, AI involves the development of
algorithms and systems that can learn, reason, and solve problems,
simulating cognitive functions.

\vspace{0.4cm}

\begin{center}
\Large
\raggedright
\textbf{2.1.1 Conceptualizing AI: Intelligent Agents}
\end{center}

AI encompasses a spectrum of concepts, from the creation of intelligent
agents capable of making decisions to the contemporary paradigm of
machine learning. Intelligent agents mimic human decision-making
processes, while machine learning leverages data and algorithms to
enable systems to improve their performance through experience.

\begin{center}
\Large
\raggedright
\textbf{2.1.2 Core Principles of AI: Learning, Reasoning, Solving}
\end{center}

Central to AI are the principles of learning, reasoning, and problem
solving. Learning mechanisms enable systems to adapt and improve based
on experience, reasoning allows machines to draw conclusions from
information, and problem solving equips them to navigate complex
scenarios.
